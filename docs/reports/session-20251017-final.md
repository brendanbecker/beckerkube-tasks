## Completed Tasks Detail

### TASK-001: Fix Registry IP Configuration
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Duration**: ~3 hours
- **Session**: 1

**Achievements**:
- Updated registry IP from 192.168.1.18 to 192.168.7.21 across all services
- Regenerated registry TLS certificate with new IP
- Created automation scripts (update-registry-ip.sh, validate-registry.sh)
- Updated 5 repositories with correct registry configuration

**Critical Learning**: Task completion requires validation, not just manifest updates

### TASK-002: Rebuild and Push Service Images
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Duration**: ~5 hours
- **Session**: 1

**Achievements**:
- Built and pushed 9 container images across 3 service groups
- FFL v0.1.18 (backend, frontend)
- MidwestMTG v0.1.12 (backend, frontend, discord-bot)
- MTG Dev Agents 417e41b (orchestrator, worker, evaluator, stenographer)
- Updated all HelmRelease manifests with new versions

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- Registry TLS certificate had old IP (discovered mid-task)
- Docker daemon insecure-registries configuration required
- Multi-arch buildx TLS complexity (switched to single-arch via localhost)

### TASK-003: Verify and Reconcile Flux Deployments
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Duration**: ~4 hours
- **Session**: 2

**Achievements**:
- Verified Flux reconciliation successful for infrastructure services
- 16 of 27 HelmReleases in READY state
- All core infrastructure operational (Istio, Prometheus, Ingress, PostgreSQL)
- FFL namespace fully deployed with health checks passing
- Identified sealed-secrets decryption issue (scoped out to TASK-006)

**Verification Evidence**:
```json
FFL Backend Health: {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0","environment":"development"}
```

### TASK-004: Remove MTG Dev Agents from Cluster
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Session**: 2

**Achievements**:
- Removed unused MTG Dev Agents from cluster configuration
- Archived apps/mtg-agents directory to archive/mtg-agents-20251017
- Archived Google Gemini API sealed secret
- Deleted empty mtg-agents namespace
- Committed 3 changes to beckerkube repository

**Rationale**: Images built but no HelmReleases exist; reducing configuration complexity

### TASK-005: Fix HelmRelease Deployment Timeouts
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Duration**: ~3 hours
- **Session**: 2

**Achievements**:
- Identified root cause: 5m default timeout insufficient for migration jobs
- Added explicit `timeout: 10m` to all failing HelmReleases
- FFL services (backend, frontend) now fully operational
- istio-ingressgateway successfully deployed
- Discovered sealed-secrets decryption issue (separate blocker)

**Services Fixed**:
- ffl-backend ✅
- ffl-frontend ✅
- istio-ingressgateway ✅

**Services Blocked by Sealed Secrets** (scoped to TASK-006):
- midwestmtg-backend ❌
- midwestmtg-frontend ❌
- midwestmtg-discord-bot ❌
- triager-orchestrator ❌
- triager-redis ❌
- ccbot ❌
- All triager workers (4 services) ❌

## Critical Discoveries

### 1. Registry TLS Certificate Verification Gap (Session 1)

**Issue**: TASK-001 marked complete but certificate wasn't actually regenerated

**Impact**: 3+ hours wasted during TASK-002 with cryptic build failures

**Resolution**: Deleted registry-tls secret, triggered cert-manager regeneration, verified with openssl

**Prevention**: Add explicit certificate verification to acceptance criteria

### 2. Sealed Secrets Key Management Gap (Session 2)

**Issue**: Sealed-secrets controller cannot decrypt secrets encrypted with previous key

**Impact**: 11 HelmReleases blocked (41% of cluster), 2 namespaces non-operational

**Root Cause**: Private key not backed up before cluster rebuild

**Affected Secrets**: 13 sealed secrets (midwestmtg: 5, triager: 6, mtg-agents: 2 archived)

**Next Steps**: TASK-006 created with 3 resolution options

### 3. Docker Daemon Configuration Requirements

**Issue**: System-level Docker daemon configuration not documented

**Discovery**: `/etc/docker/daemon.json` required `insecure-registries: ["192.168.7.21:5000"]`

**Impact**: Build failures even with correct TLS certificate

**Prevention**: Create build-machine-setup.md runbook

---

## Key Learnings

### Task Management Excellence
1. ✅ **Systematic Root Cause Analysis**: Separated timeout issues from sealed secrets (TASK-005)
2. ✅ **Proper Task Scoping**: Prevented scope creep by creating TASK-006 for new issue
3. ✅ **Real-Time Documentation**: Progress logs with timestamps enabled clear audit trail
4. ✅ **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Used logs, metrics, health checks to validate completion

### Process Improvements Needed
1. ❌ **Pre-Flight Validation Missing**: Should have validated sealed secrets before starting deployments
2. ❌ **Backup Procedures Gap**: Sealed-secrets key not backed up before cluster rebuild
3. ❌ **Build Machine Configuration Undocumented**: Docker daemon setup not in runbooks
4. ❌ **Incomplete Architecture Decisions**: MTG agents built without deployment plan

### Technical Insights
1. **Helm Timeouts**: Default 5m insufficient for database migrations (use 10m)
2. **Health Checks**: JSON endpoints provide clear success signals and version verification
3. **Infrastructure Layering**: Must bring up infrastructure → FFL (canary) → other apps
4. **Sealed Secrets**: Key management is critical infrastructure requiring documented backup/recovery

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Next Session)
1. ✅ Create TASK-006 for sealed secrets resolution (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ Generate comprehensive retrospective (COMPLETED)
3. ⏳ Search for sealed-secrets controller key backup
4. ⏳ Document sealed-secrets backup procedure

### Next Session Priorities
1. **TASK-006** (HIGH): Resolve sealed secrets decryption
   - Estimated time: 2-4 hours
   - Success criteria: All 27 HelmReleases READY
   - Validation: midwestmtg and triager services healthy

2. **Create Runbooks**:
   - docs/runbooks/sealed-secrets-backup.md
   - docs/runbooks/build-machine-setup.md
   - docs/runbooks/cluster-rebuild-verification.md

3. **Update Architecture Documentation**:
   - Document MTG agents deployment decision (ADR-001)
   - Update cluster architecture diagram
   - Document sealed secrets key management

### Process Improvements
1. **Add Pre-Flight Validation Checklist** for cluster operations:
   - Sealed secrets decryption test
   - Registry certificate verification
   - Infrastructure services health check
   - Sample application deployment (FFL as canary)

2. **Improve Task Acceptance Criteria Format**:
   - Add "In Scope" and "Out of Scope" sections
   - Include explicit verification commands
   - Use "N/A - <reason>" for out-of-scope items
   - Add "Verification Evidence" section

3. **Implement Backup Procedures**:
   - Sealed-secrets controller private key (before cluster operations)
   - Registry TLS certificates
   - Flux GPG keys (if used)
   - PostgreSQL data (if not externally managed)

### Technical Improvements
1. **Sealed Secrets Monitoring**:
   - Alert on decryption failures in controller logs
   - Dashboard showing sealed secret health
   - Regular validation (weekly cron job)

2. **Registry Certificate Management**:
   - Consider Let's Encrypt for registry TLS
   - Document multi-arch build workarounds
   - Add certificate expiration monitoring

3. **Build Infrastructure**:
   - Automate Docker daemon configuration (Ansible/Chef)
   - Add pre-build validation to all project scripts
   - Document single-arch vs. multi-arch build approaches

2. **Documentation**: Real-time progress logs provided excellent audit trail
3. **Systematic Approach**: Root cause analysis before implementing fixes
4. **Pragmatic Completion**: Completing in-scope work while documenting out-of-scope issues
5. **Clean Git Practices**: Atomic commits with clear conventional commit messages

### What Needs Improvement
1. **Pre-Flight Validation**: Should validate sealed secrets before deployment
2. **Backup Procedures**: Critical infrastructure keys must be backed up
3. **Build Machine Setup**: System-level configuration must be documented
4. **Architecture Decisions**: Must precede build/deployment operations
5. **Task Acceptance Criteria**: Should distinguish in-scope vs. out-of-scope

### Key Takeaways
