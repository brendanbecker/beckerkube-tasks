# Infrastructure Task Execution Session Report

**Session ID**: 20251017-autonomous-workflow
**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Cluster Context**: minikube
**Workflow**: Autonomous 7-phase infrastructure task execution

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed TASK-001 (Registry IP Configuration) and achieved 81% completion on TASK-002 (Service Image Builds). Built and pushed 9 container images across 3 service groups to the new registry. Discovered and resolved critical TLS certificate issue that had blocked builds.

**Key Achievement**: 3 of 4 service groups fully built and available in registry at 192.168.7.21:5000

**Critical Discovery**: TASK-001 certificate regeneration was marked complete but not actually executed, causing 3-hour delay in TASK-002

- **Tasks partially complete**: 1 (TASK-002 at 81%)
- **Service groups built**: 3 of 4 (75%)
- **Images built**: 9 of 11 target images (82%)
- **Acceptance criteria met**: 26 of 30 total criteria across both tasks (87%)

### Image Statistics

- **Total image repositories**: 16 (in registry)
- **Image tags created**: 18 (9 version tags + 9 latest/dev tags)
- **Registries updated**: 1 (192.168.7.21:5000)

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Registry TLS Certificate Had Old IP
- **Symptom**: `tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate is valid for 192.168.1.18, not 192.168.7.21`
- **Root Cause**: TASK-001 updated cert-manager manifest but didn't trigger regeneration
- **Resolution**:
  1. Deleted registry-tls secret
  2. Cert-manager auto-regenerated certificate
  3. Restarted registry deployment
  4. Verified new certificate via openssl
- **Impact**: 3+ hour delay in builds
- **Prevention**: Add explicit certificate verification to acceptance criteria

### Issue 2: Docker Daemon Insecure Registries Configuration
- **Symptom**: Docker refused to push to registry despite valid certificate
- **Root Cause**: /etc/docker/daemon.json needed explicit insecure-registries entry
- **Resolution**: User updated daemon.json and restarted Docker
- **Impact**: Additional 10-minute delay
- **Prevention**: Document in build-machine-setup.md runbook

### Issue 3: Multi-Arch Buildx TLS Errors
- **Symptom**: Docker buildx couldn't verify self-signed certificate
- **Root Cause**: Buildx multi-arch builds don't respect insecure-registries config
- **Resolution**: Switched to single-arch builds via localhost:5000 port-forward
- **Impact**: Lost multi-arch capability, 1-hour troubleshooting time
- **Trade-off**: Accepted single-arch for local dev to unblock builds

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. **HIGH**: Investigate TASK-005 (triager build failure)
   - Review build scripts for errors
   - Test manual docker build
   - Document root cause and fix
   - Estimated time: 1-2 hours

2. **HIGH**: Complete TASK-002 HelmRelease updates
   - Update FFL HelmRelease to v0.1.18
   - Update MidwestMTG HelmRelease to v0.1.12
   - Update MTG Dev Agents HelmReleases to 417e41b
   - Commit to beckerkube repository
   - Estimated time: 30 minutes

3. **MEDIUM**: Proceed with TASK-003 (Flux reconciliation)
   - After HelmRelease updates
   - Monitor pod deployments
   - Verify all services healthy
   - Estimated time: 1-2 hours

### Process Improvements

1. **Add explicit verification steps** to all task acceptance criteria:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Verify configuration applied: <validation command>
   - [ ] Test end-to-end: <test command>
   - [ ] Confirm no errors: <check command>
   ```

2. **Create build-machine-setup.md runbook** documenting:
   - Docker daemon configuration for private registry
   - Certificate trust setup
   - Registry connectivity validation
   - Common build troubleshooting

3. **Implement pre-task validation gates**:
   - Don't start dependent task until prerequisite fully verified
   - Run end-to-end test before marking task complete
   - Document validation results in progress log

### Technical Improvements

1. **Registry certificate management**:
   - Add monitoring for certificate expiration
   - Document certificate verification as standard procedure
   - Consider Let's Encrypt or trusted CA for production

2. **Build infrastructure**:
   - Automate Docker daemon configuration via Ansible
   - Add pre-build validation scripts to all projects
   - Document multi-arch workarounds for self-signed certs

## Next Session Priorities

**Primary Objective**: Complete the build and deployment pipeline

1. **TASK-005**: Investigate triager build failure (1-2 hours)
2. **TASK-002**: Update HelmRelease files (30 minutes)
3. **TASK-003**: Flux reconciliation and verification (1-2 hours)

**Estimated total time**: 3-4 hours to complete all active/backlog infrastructure tasks

**Success criteria**: All services deployed and healthy, cluster fully operational after rebuild

## Backlog Status

| Task | Status | Priority | Completion | Next Action |
|------|--------|----------|------------|-------------|
| TASK-001 | Completed | Critical | 100% | None (archived) |
| TASK-002 | Active | Critical | 81% | Complete triager builds + HelmRelease updates |
| TASK-003 | Backlog | High | 0% | Start after TASK-002 complete |
| TASK-005 | Backlog | High | 0% | Investigate triager failure (blocks TASK-002) |

## Conclusion

This session achieved substantial progress on critical post-rebuild infrastructure tasks. Successfully completed TASK-001 and advanced TASK-002 to 81% completion, building and pushing 9 container images to the new registry.

The discovery that TASK-001's certificate regeneration was incomplete highlights the importance of explicit verification steps in acceptance criteria. This learning has been incorporated into the retrospective's recommendations for future task execution.

**Overall Session Success**: 87% (26 of 30 acceptance criteria met across processed tasks)

**Infrastructure Status**: Cluster registry operational, 75% of services built and available

**Readiness for Deployment**: Ready to proceed with HelmRelease updates and Flux reconciliation after triager investigation
