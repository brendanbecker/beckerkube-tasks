## Tasks Processed

### TASK-008: Fix MidwestMTG Namespace Deployment Failures ✅
**Status**: Completed and Archived
**Priority**: High
**Component**: midwestmtg namespace (infrastructure + deployment)

**Actions Taken**:
1. Verified current cluster state
2. Confirmed all acceptance criteria met:
   - All HelmReleases READY=True (backend, frontend, discord-bot, redis)
   - All pods running/completed successfully
   - Migration job completed
   - No CrashLoopBackOff or ImagePullBackOff errors
3. Updated task file with completed acceptance criteria
4. Added final progress log entry
5. Changed status to "completed"
6. Moved task from `tasks/active/` to `tasks/completed/`
7. Committed and pushed changes

**Verification Results**:
```
HelmReleases (all READY=True):
- midwestmtg-backend: Helm upgrade succeeded (chart 0.1.13)

**Git Operations**:
- Repository: beckerkube-tasks
- Commit: 5a88f2a "Archive TASK-008: Moved to completed after successful execution"
- Pushed to: origin/main

## Current Backlog Status

**Active Tasks**: 0
**Backlog Tasks**: 0
**Completed Tasks**: 2 (TASK-006, TASK-008)

All infrastructure tasks in beckerkube-tasks repository have been completed. The backlog is now empty.

## Observations & Learnings

1. **Task Documentation Lag**: TASK-008 was marked as "infrastructure complete" with handoff to BUG-021, but the task file itself wasn't archived. The cluster state showed full resolution, but acceptance criteria weren't checked off. This highlights the importance of updating task metadata immediately upon completion.

2. **Cross-Repository Dependencies**: TASK-008 had a dependency on application-level work (BUG-021 in midwestmtg-feature-management). The infrastructure team successfully completed their portion, but the task remained open until application issues were also resolved.

3. **Agent Availability**: Specialized subagents (task-scanner-agent, infra-executor-agent, verification-agent, git-ops-agent, retrospective-agent, summary-reporter-agent) referenced in OVERPROMPT are not currently deployed. Manual fallback procedures were used successfully.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
None. All tasks completed.

### Future Improvements

1. **Deploy Specialized Agents**: Implement the specialized subagents referenced in OVERPROMPT.md to enable fully autonomous task execution without manual fallbacks.

2. **Task Hygiene**: Establish a periodic review process to ensure completed tasks are promptly archived and task metadata stays synchronized with actual cluster state.

3. **Cross-Repository Tracking**: Consider creating a unified task tracking system that can reference tasks across multiple repositories (beckerkube-tasks, midwestmtg-feature-management, etc.).

4. **State Management**: Implement `.agent-state.json` tracking for session state persistence and recovery capability.

## Next Session Priority

No tasks currently in backlog. Next session should:
1. Monitor for new tasks added to beckerkube-tasks
2. Review cluster health metrics
3. Check for any configuration drift in GitOps repositories

## Session Exit Conditions Met

- ✅ All tasks completed (queue empty)
- ✅ No consecutive failures
- ✅ Normal session completion
