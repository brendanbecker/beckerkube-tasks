## Description

Triager build script exited with code 1 very early in execution. Root cause needs to be identified and fixed before triager images can be built and pushed to the registry.

## Context

During the post-cluster-rebuild image push process, the triager build script failed immediately with exit code 1. The failure occurred early in the script execution, before any substantial build work was done.

Build script location: `~/projects/triager/scripts/build.sh`

Initial failure may have been related to:
- Wrong registry URL (192.168.7.19:5000 instead of 192.168.7.21:5000) - **NOW FIXED**
- Missing --push flag in the command
- Script error in build_component function
- Missing dependencies or Dockerfiles
- Permission issues

The registry URL has been corrected in TASK-001, but the build may still fail for other reasons.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Identify root cause of build script failure
- [x] Fix any script issues or missing dependencies
- [x] Successfully build all triager components locally
- [x] Successfully push all triager images to registry (192.168.7.21:5000)
- [x] Verify images are in registry: `curl -k https://192.168.7.21:5000/v2/triager/orchestrator/tags/list`
- [x] Document fix in this task for future reference
- [x] Update TASK-002 with triager build status

## Triager Components

Based on the triager project structure, expected components:
- **orchestrator**: Main orchestration service
- **worker**: Task processing workers
- Additional components as defined in the project

Expected images:
- `192.168.7.21:5000/triager/orchestrator:0.1.1`
- `192.168.7.21:5000/triager/worker:0.1.1`
- Others as applicable

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Examine Build Script
```bash
cd ~/projects/triager
cat scripts/build.sh
```

Look for:
- build_component function definition
- Parallel build logic
- Error handling
- Registry URL usage
- Required environment variables

### 2. Check Dockerfiles Exist
```bash
ls -la Dockerfile* */Dockerfile*
```

Verify all expected Dockerfiles are present and valid.

### 3. Test Build Manually
```bash
# Try building one component at a time
docker build -t triager/orchestrator:test -f orchestrator/Dockerfile .

# Or use build script with verbose output
bash -x scripts/build.sh
```

### 4. Check Dependencies
```bash
# Verify Docker is running
docker info

# Check disk space
df -h

# Verify registry is accessible
curl -k https://192.168.7.21:5000/v2/_catalog
```

### 5. Review Build Logs
Look for error messages in build output that indicate:
- Missing files or directories
- Syntax errors in Dockerfile
- Network connectivity issues
- Permission denied errors

## Known Issues

### Registry URL (FIXED)
- Build script had hardcoded registry URL: 192.168.7.19:5000
- **Status**: Fixed in TASK-001
- Retry needed with correct URL: 192.168.7.21:5000

### Missing --push Flag
- Build command may not have included --push flag
- Verify script accepts and handles --push parameter correctly

## Build Command to Try

After debugging:
```bash
cd ~/projects/triager
REGISTRY_URL=192.168.7.21:5000 VERSION=0.1.1 ./scripts/build.sh --push
```

Or with verbose debugging:
```bash
cd ~/projects/triager
REGISTRY_URL=192.168.7.21:5000 VERSION=0.1.1 bash -x ./scripts/build.sh --push
```

## Dependencies

**Required For:**
- **TASK-002**: Triager images must be built before task can be completed
- **TASK-003**: Triager deployment depends on images being available

**Prerequisites:**
- TASK-001 completed (registry IP configuration fixed) âœ…
- Docker daemon running
- Registry accessible at 192.168.7.21:5000
- Sufficient disk space for image layers

## Progress Log

- 2025-10-17 09:40: Initial build attempt failed with exit code 1
- 2025-10-17 10:15: Registry IP corrected from 192.168.7.19 to 192.168.7.21
- 2025-10-17 10:40: Task created to track investigation
- 2025-10-17 11:00: Awaiting investigation and retry
- 2025-10-17 14:10: **Investigation completed** - Root cause: Registry IP was wrong (fixed in TASK-001)
- 2025-10-17 14:35: **Build started** - Running parallel build script with --push --tag 0.1.1
- 2025-10-17 14:36: **BUILD SUCCESS** - All 5 triager components built and pushed successfully:
  - triager-orchestrator:0.1.1 (digest: c5355264...)
  - triager-classifier-worker:0.1.1 (digest: c95af466...)
  - triager-duplicate-worker:0.1.1 (digest: 4c67b2d2...)
  - triager-doc-generator-worker:0.1.1 (digest: da357d17...)
  - triager-git-manager-worker:0.1.1 (digest: 0b0d404d...)
- 2025-10-17 14:36: Verified all images in registry at 192.168.7.21:5000
- 2025-10-17 14:37: **TASK COMPLETED** - All acceptance criteria met, triager builds unblocked

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Examine build script and identify failure point
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/triager
   cat scripts/build.sh
   # Look for syntax errors, missing functions, incorrect variables
   ```

2. **Debugging**: Run build script with verbose output
   ```bash
   bash -x scripts/build.sh
   # Capture full output to identify exact failure point
   ```

3. **Fix Issues**: Address identified problems
   - Fix script syntax errors
   - Add missing files or dependencies
   - Correct configuration issues

4. **Test Build**: Build one component manually to verify Dockerfile is valid
   ```bash
   docker build -t test:latest -f <path-to-dockerfile> .
   ```

5. **Full Build**: Once issue is resolved, run full build with push
   ```bash
   REGISTRY_URL=192.168.7.21:5000 VERSION=0.1.1 ./scripts/build.sh --push
   ```

6. **Verify**: Check images are in registry
   ```bash
   curl -k https://192.168.7.21:5000/v2/_catalog
   curl -k https://192.168.7.21:5000/v2/triager/orchestrator/tags/list
   ```

7. **Update Tasks**: Update TASK-002 with success status

## Possible Root Causes

### Script Errors
- Missing function definition
- Syntax error in bash script
- Incorrect parameter handling
- Missing error handling

### Missing Files
- Dockerfile not found
- Required source files missing
- Build context issues

### Environment Issues
- Required environment variables not set
- Docker not running or accessible
- Registry not accessible
- Insufficient permissions

### Configuration Issues
- Wrong registry URL (now fixed)
- Missing build arguments
- Incorrect image naming

## Success Criteria

Task is complete when:
- Root cause identified and documented
- Fix implemented and tested
- All triager images built successfully
- All images pushed to registry 192.168.7.21:5000
- Images verified in registry catalog
- TASK-002 updated with triager completion status

## Notes

- Keep detailed notes of debugging process for future reference
- If build script has issues, consider refactoring for better error handling
- May want to add pre-build validation checks (Docker running, registry accessible, etc.)
- Consider adding retry logic for transient failures
- Document any special build requirements or dependencies
