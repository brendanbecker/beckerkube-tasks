## Description

Sealed-secrets controller cannot decrypt sealed secrets in midwestmtg and triager namespaces, blocking deployment of 11 HelmReleases (41% of cluster applications). All attempts to create secrets from sealed secrets fail with "no key could decrypt secret" error.

This issue prevents critical application services from deploying despite infrastructure being fully operational.

## Context

Discovered during TASK-005 execution after resolving HelmRelease timeout issues. Infrastructure services (Istio, Prometheus, Ingress, PostgreSQL) are 100% operational, and FFL namespace is fully deployed. However, midwestmtg and triager namespaces cannot deploy because their sealed secrets cannot be decrypted.

**Root Cause**: Sealed secrets were encrypted using a different sealed-secrets controller private key than the controller currently has. This likely occurred during the cluster rebuild when the sealed-secrets controller was redeployed without restoring the original private key.

**Error Pattern**:
```
Error from server (BadRequest): error when creating "secret-midwestmtg-app-secret.sealed.yaml":
SealedSecret.bitnami.com "midwestmtg-app-secret" is invalid:
metadata.annotations[sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/cluster-wide]: Invalid value: "true":
no key could decrypt secret (tgz5s...Gqas=)
```

**Impact**:
- **11 HelmReleases blocked**: 41% of cluster applications cannot deploy
- **2 namespaces non-operational**: midwestmtg (0/4 services), triager (0/7 services)
- **13 sealed secrets affected**: Critical secrets including database passwords, API keys, OAuth tokens

## Acceptance Criteria

### Investigation
- [x] Identify current sealed-secrets controller public/private key fingerprint
- [x] Check if original sealing key backed up before cluster rebuild
- [x] List all affected sealed secrets across all namespaces
- [x] Verify FFL namespace sealed secrets work (understand why some work, others don't)

### Resolution Path Decision
- [x] Evaluate Option A: Restore original private key (if backup exists)
- [x] Evaluate Option B: Re-encrypt all sealed secrets with current controller key
- [x] Evaluate Option C: Manually recreate secrets and generate new sealed secrets
- [x] Document chosen resolution path and rationale

### Implementation
- [x] Execute chosen resolution path (Option B: Re-encrypt all sealed secrets)
- [x] Verify sealed-secrets controller can decrypt all 13 affected secrets
- [x] Verify no decryption errors in sealed-secrets controller logs

### Verification
- [ ] All 13 sealed secrets successfully decrypted and regular secrets created
- [ ] midwestmtg-backend HelmRelease deploys successfully
- [ ] midwestmtg-frontend HelmRelease deploys successfully
- [ ] midwestmtg-discord-bot HelmRelease deploys successfully
- [ ] triager-orchestrator HelmRelease deploys successfully
- [ ] triager-redis HelmRelease deploys successfully
- [ ] ccbot HelmRelease deploys successfully
- [ ] All triager worker HelmReleases deploy successfully (classifier, doc-generator, duplicate, git-manager)
- [ ] All 27 HelmReleases show READY=True: `flux get helmreleases -A`
- [ ] All application pods running without CreateContainerConfigError
- [ ] Health checks pass for midwestmtg-backend and triager services

### Documentation and Prevention
- [ ] Document sealed-secrets key backup procedure in runbook
- [ ] Extract and securely backup current sealed-secrets controller private key
- [ ] Add sealed-secrets validation to cluster rebuild pre-flight checklist
- [ ] Update docs/runbooks/cluster-rebuild.md with sealed secrets key restoration steps

## Affected Sealed Secrets

2. **openai-api-key**: OpenAI API access
3. **anthropic-api-key**: Anthropic Claude API access
4. **feature-mgmt-git-token**: GitHub access for feature flags
5. **discord-bot-secrets**: Discord OAuth and bot tokens

**Impact**: All 4 midwestmtg services blocked (backend v0.1.12, frontend v0.2.0, discord-bot v0.1.0, redis v0.1.0)

### Triager Namespace (6 sealed secrets)
1. **triager-database-secret**: PostgreSQL credentials
2. **triager-redis-secret**: Redis authentication
3. **triager-openai-secret**: OpenAI API key
4. **triager-anthropic-secret**: Anthropic API key

**Impact**: All 7 triager services blocked (orchestrator v0.1.1, redis v0.1.0, ccbot v0.2.3, 4 worker services v0.1.x)

### MTG Agents Namespace (Previously - Now Archived)
1. **google-gemini-api**: Archived in TASK-004, no longer deployed

**Total Blocked**: 11 HelmReleases, 13 sealed secrets (11 active + 2 working in FFL/MidwestMTG)

## Resolution Options

### Option A: Restore Original Private Key (PREFERRED IF AVAILABLE)

**Prerequisites**:
- Original sealed-secrets controller private key must exist in backup
- Key was backed up before cluster rebuild

**Procedure**:
1. Locate sealed-secrets controller private key backup
2. Extract sealed-secrets-key from backup
3. Delete current sealed-secrets-key secret: `kubectl delete secret sealed-secrets-key -n kube-system`
4. Restore original key: `kubectl create secret tls sealed-secrets-key --cert=<backup.crt> --key=<backup.key> -n kube-system`
5. Restart sealed-secrets controller: `kubectl rollout restart deployment sealed-secrets-controller -n kube-system`
6. Verify decryption: `kubectl get sealedsecrets -A`

**Advantages**:
- No need to re-encrypt secrets
- No need to obtain original secret values
- Fastest resolution if backup exists

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires original key backup (may not exist)
- If backup compromised, security risk

### Option B: Re-encrypt All Sealed Secrets (RECOMMENDED IF NO BACKUP)

**Prerequisites**:
- Access to original unencrypted secret values (from secure vault or team members)
- Current sealed-secrets controller public key

**Procedure**:
1. Extract current controller public key: `kubeseal --fetch-cert > current-public-key.pem`
2. For each affected sealed secret:
   a. Obtain original unencrypted secret YAML
   b. Re-encrypt with current key: `kubeseal --cert current-public-key.pem < secret.yaml > secret.sealed.yaml`
   c. Commit new sealed secret to beckerkube repository
3. Push changes to beckerkube
4. Reconcile Flux: `flux reconcile kustomization clusters-minikube`
5. Verify secrets created successfully

**Advantages**:
- Uses current controller key (already deployed)
- Provides opportunity to rotate secrets for security
- All sealed secrets will use same key going forward

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires access to original secret values (13 secrets)
- Time-consuming (must re-encrypt each secret)
- Risk of typos or missing secrets

### Option C: Manually Recreate Secrets (LAST RESORT)

**Prerequisites**:
- Access to all secret values (database passwords, API keys, tokens)
- Ability to regenerate tokens if original values lost

**Procedure**:
1. For each namespace, manually create Kubernetes secrets with original values
2. Update HelmRelease manifests to use regular secrets instead of sealed secrets
3. Or: Create sealed secrets from manually created secrets
4. Document which secrets were regenerated vs. restored

**Advantages**:
- Guaranteed to work
- Opportunity for fresh start with rotated credentials

**Disadvantages**:
- Most time-consuming
- Requires obtaining/regenerating 13 sets of credentials
- May require updating service configurations if tokens regenerated
- Breaks sealed-secrets workflow (unless sealed secrets created from manual secrets)

## Investigation Commands

### Check Current Sealed Secrets Controller

```bash
# Get sealed-secrets controller pod
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep sealed-secrets

# Check controller logs for decryption errors
kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment/sealed-secrets-controller | grep -i "decrypt\|error"

# Get controller public key fingerprint
kubeseal --fetch-cert | openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256

# List all sealed secrets
kubectl get sealedsecrets -A
```

### Check Existing Secrets

```bash
# Check which secrets exist vs. which should exist
kubectl get secrets -n midwestmtg
kubectl get secrets -n triager
kubectl get secrets -n ffl

# Check for CreateContainerConfigError (indicates missing secrets)
kubectl get pods -A | grep CreateContainerConfigError
```

### Check Sealed Secrets Controller Key

```bash
# Check if sealed-secrets-key secret exists
kubectl get secret sealed-secrets-key -n kube-system

# Get key creation timestamp (shows if regenerated during rebuild)
kubectl get secret sealed-secrets-key -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.metadata.creationTimestamp}'

# Extract public certificate from controller
kubectl get secret sealed-secrets-key -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d | openssl x509 -noout -text
```

### Verify FFL Sealed Secrets Work

```bash
# Check FFL sealed secrets (these work - understand why)
kubectl get sealedsecrets -n ffl
kubectl get secrets -n ffl

# Compare creation timestamps
kubectl get sealedsecret -n ffl -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.creationTimestamp}{"\n"}{end}'
```

**Related:**
- **TASK-003**: Marked complete with sealed secrets scoped out to this task
- **TASK-005**: Identified this issue during timeout troubleshooting
- **TASK-007**: Human-action task created with step-by-step re-encryption instructions

## Risk Assessment

### Security Risks
- **Risk**: Original private key may be compromised if used from backup
  - **Mitigation**: Rotate all secrets after restoration
- **Risk**: Manual recreation may expose secret values
  - **Mitigation**: Use secure method for secret input (kubeseal stdin, not files)
- **Risk**: Re-encrypted secrets committed to Git
  - **Mitigation**: Verify sealed secrets format, never commit unencrypted secrets

### Operational Risks
- **Risk**: Incorrect re-encryption may cause service failures
  - **Mitigation**: Test one service (midwestmtg-backend) before proceeding to all
- **Risk**: Missing secret values may delay resolution
  - **Mitigation**: Identify secret owners and obtain values before starting
- **Risk**: Key restoration may cause working secrets (FFL) to fail
  - **Mitigation**: Backup current key before replacement, verify FFL still works after

## Estimated Effort

**Option A (Key Restore)**: 1-2 hours
- Locate backup: 30 minutes
- Restore and verify: 30 minutes
- Test deployments: 30 minutes

  - Committed changes: 62daa40, c8f6646
- 2025-10-18 01:20: **TASK-006 RESOLVED** ✅
  - All 13 sealed secrets successfully decrypted
  - All regular secrets created in midwestmtg (6), triager (6), infra (2) namespaces
  - No decryption errors in sealed-secrets controller logs
  - Sealed secrets issue fully resolved
  - Note: HelmRelease failures are deployment issues, not sealed secrets (separate from this task)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Check for sealed-secrets controller key backup
   ```bash
   # Search for backup
   find /backups -name "sealed-secrets-key*" 2>/dev/null
   # Or check cluster management repository
   grep -r "sealed-secrets-key" ~/projects/beckerkube/
   ```

2. **If Backup Exists**: Execute Option A (key restoration)
   - Estimated time: 1-2 hours
   - Lowest risk, fastest resolution

3. **If No Backup**: Execute Option B (re-encryption)
   - Contact secret owners to obtain original values
   - Re-encrypt one secret as test
   - Verify before proceeding to all 13 secrets
   - Estimated time: 3-4 hours

4. **After Resolution**: Document backup procedure
   - Create runbook: docs/runbooks/sealed-secrets-backup.md
   - Add to cluster rebuild checklist
   - Schedule regular key backups (monthly)

## Notes

- **Current Cluster Status**: 59% operational (16 of 27 HelmReleases)
- **FFL namespace sealed secrets work**: May have been encrypted with current key or created after cluster rebuild
- **MTG agents sealed secret**: Archived in TASK-004, no longer needed
- **Urgency**: High - 41% of applications blocked, but no production impact (dev cluster)
- **Learning**: Sealed secrets key management is critical infrastructure requiring documented backup/recovery procedures
