## Description

All services need to be rebuilt and pushed with incremented version numbers, not just "latest" tags. After the cluster rebuild, images need to be pushed to the new registry IP with proper semantic versioning.

This task tracks the rebuild and push of all service container images to ensure they are available in the registry for Flux deployments.

## Context

After the cluster rebuild:
- **CCbot**: Successfully built and pushed (v2.0.2) ✅
- **FFL**: Build failed due to wrong registry IP, needs rebuild with version 0.1.18
- **Midwestmtg**: Built but not pushed (missing --push flag), needs version 0.1.12+
- **Triager**: Build failed, needs investigation and version 0.1.1+
- **MTG Dev Agents**: Still building evaluator, various versions

Registry URL: 192.168.7.21:5000

## Service Version Matrix

| Service | Current Chart Version | Target Image Version | Status |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|---------|
| CCbot | 2.0.1 | 2.0.2 | ✅ Complete |
| FFL Backend | 0.1.17 | 0.1.18 | ✅ Complete |
| FFL Frontend | 0.1.17 | 0.1.18 | ✅ Complete |
| MidwestMTG Backend | >=0.1.11 <1.0.0 | 0.1.12 | ✅ Complete |
| MidwestMTG Frontend | >=0.1.11 <1.0.0 | 0.1.12 | ✅ Complete |
| MidwestMTG Discord Bot | >=0.1.11 <1.0.0 | 0.1.12 | ✅ Complete |
| Triager Orchestrator | >=0.1.0 <1.0.0 | 0.1.1 | ❌ Blocked by TASK-005 |
| MTG Dev Agents - Orchestrator | Check chart | 417e41b | ✅ Complete |
| MTG Dev Agents - Worker | Check chart | 417e41b | ✅ Complete |
| MTG Dev Agents - Evaluator | Check chart | 417e41b | ✅ Complete |

REGISTRY_URL=192.168.7.21:5000 VERSION=0.1.18 ./scripts/build.sh --push all
```

### MidwestMTG (version 0.1.12)

```

### Triager (version 0.1.1)
```bash
# First investigate failure (TASK-005), then:
cd ~/projects/triager
REGISTRY_URL=192.168.7.21:5000 VERSION=0.1.1 ./scripts/build.sh --push
```

### MTG Dev Agents
```bash
cd ~/projects/mtg_dev_agents
# Check current build status first
make build
# Or build specific agents:
make build-orchestrator
make build-worker
make build-evaluator
make build-stenographer
```

## Dependencies

- **TASK-001**: Must be completed first (registry IP configuration)
- **TASK-005**: Triager build failure must be resolved

## Blocks

- **TASK-003**: Flux reconciliation depends on all images being available

## Progress Log

- 2025-10-17 09:00: CCbot successfully built and pushed (v2.0.2)
- 2025-10-17 09:30: FFL build failed due to wrong registry IP in .env.build.local
- 2025-10-17 09:35: Midwestmtg built successfully but not pushed (missing --push flag)

- 2025-10-17 10:40: Ready to retry FFL and midwestmtg builds
- 2025-10-17 13:20: **CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND** - Registry TLS certificate still had old IP (192.168.1.18) instead of new IP (192.168.7.21)

- 2025-10-17 13:30: Restarted registry deployment to pick up new TLS certificate

- 2025-10-17 14:30: Verified registry catalog - confirmed all 16 repositories including 9 newly built images
- 2025-10-17 14:35: Updated TASK-002 acceptance criteria - 17/21 completed (81% complete)
- 2025-10-17 14:40: **TASK-002 STATUS**: Mostly complete - Only triager builds blocked by TASK-005, HelmRelease updates remain

## Next Steps

1. ✅ ~~Retry FFL build with corrected registry IP~~ - **COMPLETED**

2. ✅ ~~Push midwestmtg images that were already built~~ - **COMPLETED**

3. ✅ ~~Wait for MTG Dev Agents build to complete, then verify~~ - **COMPLETED**

4. **High Priority (BLOCKED)**: Investigate triager build failure - **See TASK-005**

5. **After TASK-005**: Build and push triager images with version 0.1.1

6. **After All Builds**: Update HelmRelease files in beckerkube with new image versions:
   - FFL: 0.1.18
   - MidwestMTG: 0.1.12
   - MTG Dev Agents: 417e41b
   - Triager: 0.1.1 (pending TASK-005)

7. **After HelmRelease Updates**: Trigger Flux reconciliation and verify deployments (TASK-003)

## Notes

- Always use explicit version tags, not "latest"
- Version numbers should follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Update Helm chart versions to match or increment appropriately
- Document any build issues or special considerations
- Consider automating version increment in CI/CD pipeline
- Keep track of which versions are deployed in each environment

## Troubleshooting

If builds fail:
1. Check Docker daemon is running
2. Verify registry is accessible: `curl -k https://192.168.7.21:5000/v2/_catalog`
3. Check registry certificate is trusted
4. Verify .env.build.local has correct registry URL
5. Check build logs for specific errors
6. Ensure sufficient disk space for image layers
